***** Ways to set up jQuery *****



Local Installation - Downloaded to the local machine and then inclueded into the HTML code. 

CDN based version - Allows for us to Link the libary Through Content Delivery Network (CDN).

For this activity i will be using the CDN method. Which steps i have listed below.



For google CND the code below is used:
 
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>



Microsoft CDN code below:

 
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>


According to the jQuery Tutorial we are working though using the CDN linked method is faster
compared to local version. This is only faster by a few milliseconds. but seems to be the better 
choice for me.
